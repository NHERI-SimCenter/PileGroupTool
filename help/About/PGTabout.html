<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The SimCenter Pile Group Tool provides a live interface to study the behavior of a pile or pile group in layered soil.  It allows the user to interactively (and nearly instantly) observe the system's response to changes of the following parameters:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 soil structure (up to 3 layers of variable thickness), soil properties,
</li>
<li>
 position of the ground water table,
</li>
<li>
 pile stiffness, embedment length, connection type to the pile cap,
</li>
<li>
 number of piles in the group (one to three piles), and
</li>
<li>
 the applied horizontal force, vertical force, and moment at the pile cap (building loads).
</li>
<li>
 the applied horizontal and vertical displacement at the pile cap (push-over analysis).
</li>
<li>
 an applied soil motion profile to quasi-statically emulate liquefaction (soil motion effects).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Presented results include
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 lateral and axial displacements of all piles,
</li>
<li>
 moment, shear, and axial force diagrams for each pile,
</li>
<li>
 vertical soil stresses
</li>
<li>
 ultimate strength and stiffness parameters for the employed p-y and t-z springs.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="background">Technical background</h2>
<p>
The soil-structure system is modeled using the OpenSees finite element platform [1].
</p>
<p>
The pile group is represented as multiple displacement-based elastic beams, connected by a semi-rigid pile cap. The connection between piles and pile cap can be modeled as flexible (hinged) or moment bearing (equal DOF constraint).
</p>
<p>
Soil-structure interaction is represented by appropriate nonlinear p-y spring (t-z spring) elements for lateral (axial) movement.  Spring properties are computed using Hansen's method [2] and recommendations by the American Petroleum Institute (API) [3].  A toe resistance can be added using an isolated T-z spring at the toe of each pile.
</p>
<p>
The Pile Group Tool constructs a structurally and numerically appropriate finite element mesh, computes spring properties from soil properties, and places spring elements accordingly.  The actual simulation employs a Newton-Raphson iterative procedure to solve the governing nonlinear system of equations.
</p>
<p>
The user can quickly explore the effect of changing pile and soil properties to lateral pile deformation, internal pile moment and shear distributions, overburden stress in the soil, and spring parameters as obtained through Hansen [2] and API [3] procedures.  Moreover, the user can easily add and remove piles by the click of a button to observe the effect of a pile group versus a single pile foundation.
