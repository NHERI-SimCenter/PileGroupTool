    The Pile Group Tool uses metric units: meters, kN, and kPa.

    Select piles or soil layers to display and/or change by clicking on the pile inside the System Plot
    <br>
</li>
<li>
    Explore different loading scenarios by switching between:
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li>Force control: control forces and moments at the center of the pile cap</li>
    <li>Push-over and Pull-out: use displacement control to experiment with limit states</li>
    <li>Soil motion profile: a quasi-static approach to model liquefaction effects on the pile group</li>
    </ol>

<li>
    You can export the current analysis to a fully functional OpenSees inputfile (File menu).
