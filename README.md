# Pile Group Tool

The SimCenter Pile-Group Tool provides a dynamic interface to study the behavior of a pile or pile-group in layered soil. It allows the user to interactively (and nearly instantly) observe the system's response to changes of the following parameters:

* soil structure (up to 3 layers of variable thickness) and soil properties
* position of the ground water table
* pile stiffness, embedment length, connection type to the pile cap
* number of piles in the group (one to three piles)
* the applied horizontal and vertical forces and moment at the pile cap (push-over analysis)

## Presented results include:

* axial and lateral displacement of all piles
* moment, shear and force diagrams for each pile
* vertical soil stresses
* ultimate strength and stiffness parameters for the employed p-y springs

## Technical background:

The soil-structure system is modeled using a finite-element platform. Piles are represented by displacement based beam-column elements. Soil-structure interaction is represented laterally by p-y springs and tangentially by t-z springs. Spring properties are computed using Hansen's method [1] and recommendations by the American Petroleum Institute (API) [2]. The Pile-Group Tool constructs a structurally and numerically appropriate finite-element mesh, computes spring properties from soil properties, and places spring elements accordingly. The actual simulation employs a Newton-Raphson iterative procedure to solve the governing nonlinear system of equations.
